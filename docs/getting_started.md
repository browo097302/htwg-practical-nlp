# Getting Started

This page describes how to set up your environment for this course.

## Accounts

To get the most out of this course, you should have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Mural](https://www.mural.co/) account.
Both services are free to use.

!!! tip

    You can use your HTWG email address to register for GitHub and Mural.
    This will make it easier to identify you as a member of this course.

## Install Python

The recommended Python version for this course is 3.12. in a virtual environment.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux"

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3.12
    sudo apt install python3.12-venv
    ```

    In case this doesn't work, try to add the [deadsnakes PPA](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) to your system, and try again.

    ```sh
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-apple: Mac"

    On Mac, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Python.

    ```sh
    brew install python@3.12
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

    On Windows, it is recommended to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
    Then you can follow the instructions for Linux.

    If you are a VS Code user, you need to [install the WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).

    There is currently no setup guide for native Windows, but I'm happy to accept a pull request for [this issue](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/issues/12). ðŸ˜‰

!!! warning

    You are free to use another Python version if you wish, but be aware that this may cause problems with the provided code.
    Also if you are using Python outside a virtual environment or with a distribution like Anaconda, the described setup may not work.

## Clone the repository

Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.
Now you can clone the course repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp.git
```

!!! tip

    While cloning the course repository, as described here, lets you _participate_ in the course,
    it is generally recommended to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) the course repository.

    That way you can _contribute_ back bug fixes, enhancements, etc., which is highly encouraged and appreciated ðŸš€

    You can find more details about contributing and forking the course repository in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Execute the setup script

The setup script is provided as a `Makefile`.
Change into the repository directory and execute the setup script.
This should create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies.

```sh
cd htwg-practical-nlp
make
```

This may take a few minutes. â˜•

If everything went well, you should be good to go.

From now, make sure that you have the virtual environment activated.
Usually, the IDE should automatically suggest you to activate it (e.g. VSCode).
If that is not the case, you can activate the virtual environment with the following command

```sh
# activate the virtual environment manually
source .venv/bin/activate

# in case you need to deactivate it
deactivate
```

## Test your installation

You can test your installation by running the tests for the first assignment.

```sh
make assignment-1
```

In your terminal, you should see lots of failed tests. ðŸ˜¨

But this is exactly what we want to see, since we haven't implemented anything yet! ðŸ¤“

!!! info

    You can find more details on how we handle assignments on the [corresponding page](./assignments.md).

If you came this far, your initial setup was successful and you are ready to go! ðŸš€

Now we can take a look at some other components of the repository.

## Start Jupyter server

Some of the assignments are accompanied by Jupyter notebooks.

If your IDE supports it, you can execute the Jupyter notebooks natively in your IDE (e.g. using the [VSCode Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)).

If you prefer the web UI, you can start the Jupyter server with the following command.

```sh
make jupyter
```

Jupyter is now accessible at <http://localhost:8888/>.

!!! info

    Of course you can also use JupyterLab if you wish, but this is not included in the setup script.

## Serve the lecture notes

If you want, you can bring up the lecture notes on your local machine.

```sh
make docs
```

The lecture notes are now accessible at <http://localhost:8000/>.

## Pulling updates

Every now and then, the course repository will be updated.
To incorporate these updates, you will need to pull from the `main` branch:

```sh
# make sure you are on to the main branch
git checkout main

# pull the updates from the remote repository
git pull
```

!!! note

    For a fork, the process is a little different, and described in detail in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#syncing-you-fork)

!!! tip

    It is good practice to pull the latest changes from `main` every now and then (just in case you are wondering why your assignment tests suddenly fail ðŸ˜…). However, important updates will be announced in the lecture.
