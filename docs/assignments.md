# Assignments

During the semester, each student has to complete a couple of assignments.
The assignments are ungraded, but they are mandatory to pass the course.

If you have basic programming skills, you should be able to complete the assignments.

## Package structure

Throughout the course, we will work on a Python package called `htwgnlp`.
The package is located in the `src` directory and is a fully functional and installable Python package.
The core sturcture will be provided, and the assignments will be about implementing the missing functionality.

To work on an assignment, you will need to locate the `TODO ASSIGNMENT-*` items in the code.

!!! example

    For example, to work on the first assignment, use the search functionality of your IDE to find all relevant items:

    ```txt
    TODO ASSIGNMENT-1
    ```

!!! tip

    You should check the unit tests located in the `tests` directory to see the exact requirements that need to be implemented.

## Testing your implementation

Once you implemented everything, you can run the tests to check if everything works as expected.

You can run the tests using the provided `make assignment-*` commands.
If all your tests pass, you successfully completed the assignment! ðŸš€

!!! example

    For example, to test your implementation for the first assignment, you can run:

    ```sh
    make assignment-1
    ```

!!! tip

    If your IDE provides the functionality, you can also run the tests directly from the IDE.

!!! note

    You can also use the native `pytest` commands, but then you need to know the exact path to the tests:

    ```sh
    # make sure to have the virtual environment activated
    pytest tests/htwgnlp/test_preprocessing.py
    ```

    Pytest is a very powerful testing framework and the de-facto standard for testing in Python.
    You will not need to know all the details, but if you want to learn more, check out the [official Pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html).

## Run Jupyter notebooks

Some of the assignments are accompanied by Jupyter notebooks.

If you successfully complete an assignment, you can run the accompanying notebook and see your code in action.

See the [Getting Started](./getting_started.md) guide for instructions on how to start the Jupyter server.

## Submit assignment

To submit an assignment, you will need to provide screenshots of a successful test run.

<!-- TODO issue-121 provide example screenshot -->

You can submit the screenshots via GitHub issue using the issue template for [Assignment Submission](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/issues/new/choose).

!!! note

    Submission via GitHub issue is preferred, but it is also accpeted if submit the screenshots via [email](mailto:pascal.keilbach@htwg-konstanz.de).

## Working on your assignments

How you work on your assignments on your local machine is completely up to you.
But following a consistent branching strategy will probably make you life easier.

!!! info

    This is regardless of whether you use the recommended approach to fork the repository, or just clone it locally.

!!! note

    Feel free to skip this section if you have basic familiarity with git and branching workflows.

!!! tip

    If you are new to git or not very experienced, this is a great learing opportunity for you, as git is a very important tool in nowadays software development.
    You can work on the assignments without getting too much into git, but this is a great way to gain some experience with git.

### Using a single branch

Generally, it is recommended to work on your assignments in a separte branch:

```sh
git checkout -b my-assigments
```

Then, you can work on your assignments and commit your changes locally:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "solution for assignment 1"
```

!!! tip

    If you work on a fork, you can also push your changes to your remote repository.
    This is not possible if you just clone the course repository.

### Using multiple branches

Similarly, you could create a new branch for each assignment. This can help you to keep your work separated.

```sh
git checkout -b my-assigments-1
git add .
git commit -m "solution for assignment 1"
```

### Using your local working tree

If you don't want to deal with git, you could also work purely locally without committing anything.

!!! warning

    This is not recommended, as this bears the risk of losing your progress, or dealing with lots of merge conflicts.
    When pulling updates, you probably need to [stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) your changes.
    But be careful: if not done properly, you may lose your progress! ðŸ˜±

## Pulling updates

As described in the getting started guide, there will be [updates](getting_started.md#pulling-updates) from time to time.
It can happen that these updates affect the assignments (just in case you are wondering why your tests suddenly fail ðŸ˜…).

Given that you work on a separate branch on your assignments, you can merge the latest version of the `main` branch into your assignment branch as follows:

```sh
# Fetch the latest changes from the remote main branch
git fetch origin main

# Merge the main branch into your current feature branch, e.g. my-assignments
git merge origin/main
```

!!! info

    In case you work on a fork (which is awesome ðŸ™Œ), the process is similar, but you need to fetch from the `upstream` remote repository.
    This is described in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#syncing-you-fork) in more detail.
